DESIGN -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Components we'll need to build our bot:
- Two chat message containers to display messages from the user and the bot, respectively.
- A chat input widget so the user can type in a message.
- A way to store the chat history so we can display it in the chat message containers.


CONCEPTS ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. saving the chat history to st.session_state.messages
Streamlit apps are stateless by default—they re-run from top to bottom on every user interaction. Without explicitly storing the chat history, all the messages would disappear whenever:
    - The user enters a new message.
    - The app re-renders due to an interaction (e.g., a button click or input submission)

2. generator function to make the assistant’s reply appear incrementally rather than all at once
